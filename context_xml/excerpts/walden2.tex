as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England; something
about your condition, especially your outward condition or circumstances in
this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary that it be as
bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I have travelled a
good deal in Concord; and every where, in shops, and offices, and fields, the
inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable
ways. What I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking
in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downwards, over
flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders "until it becomes
impossible for them to resume their natural position, while from the twist of
the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach;" or dwelling , chained
for life, at the foot of a tree; or measuring with their bodies, like
caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or standing on one leg on the tops
of pillars,---even these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible
and astonishing than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of
Hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have
undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could never see
that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor. they have
no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydra's head, but as
soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.
