TeXML: an XML syntax for TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt)

     * Do you generate TeX code? Then download and try TeXML.
     * Do you convert XML to TeX? Then you ought to use TeXML.

   TeXML  is  an  XML  syntax for TeX. The processor transforms the TeXML
   markup  into  the  TeX  markup,  escaping  special and out-of-encoding
   characters.  The  intended  audience  is  developers who automatically
   generate [La]TeX or ConTeXt files.

TeXML vs XSL-FO

     * Both  TeXML  and XSL-FO are an intermediate step in publishing XML
       as PDF.
     * -- With XSL-FO, you create or re-use an XSL-FO stylesheet.
       --  By  analogue,  with  TeXML,  you  create  or  re-use  a  TeXML
       stylesheet.
     * -- Open-source XSL-FO tools are not yet of the production quality,
       -- LaTeX is.
     * -- XSL-FO is for good enough PDFs,
       --  TeXML  is  targeted  to  the  minority  who  create  excellent
       documents.

TeXML vs Perl/Java/Python/etc

   Traditional  languages  are  not  convinient  to work with XML. On the
   other hand, when using XSLT, generating valid TeX syntax is nightmare.
   The solution is TeXML.
   
     * XSLT  is  an ideal tool to convert XML to XML, and TeXML is an XML
       syntax for TeX.
     * A TeXML processor makes the rest, serializing TeXML to TeX.

TeXML benefits

     * LaTeX and ConTeXt support.
     * No need to bother about escaping TeX special characters.
     * No need to bother about empty lines in paragraphs.
     * More than 700 unicode characters are mapped to LaTeX commands.
     * Support for international publishing.
     * Generated TeX code is human-friendly.
     * Open  source  under  the  MIT/X Consortium license. Can be used in
       commercial applications.
