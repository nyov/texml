Version 0.98.beta (02 April 2004)

* Text of specification is now better. Thanks Simon Goodson for
  ideas on improvement.
* New handling of tags <parm/> and <opt/>. The processor now outputs
  them instantly as they appear, and so multiple parameters of one
  <cmd/> are not being united.
* Absence of spaces after LaTeX commands in some mappings is fixed.


Version 0.95.beta (26 March 2004)

* Ligatures "--" and "---" are being processed. This is configurable.
* Escaping of TeX specials is configurable.
* Translation of empty line is configurable.
* Default encoding of output now is ascii, not utf8.
* ChangeLog file is created.


Version 0.91.beta (22 March 2004)

* Under Windows, TeXML processor now creates lines with DOS endings.
  Code should also work correctly in other systems (MacOS etc).


Version 0.90.beta (19 March 2004)

* First packaged version of the TeXML.
