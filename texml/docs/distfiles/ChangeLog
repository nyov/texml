Version 1.1 (????? 2004)

* Advanced whitespace processing is implemented: the program
  (a) removes what XML regards as insignificant whitespace, and
  (b) introduces its own whitespace which would look reasonable
      from a human point of view.
* A new attribute @ws of the element <TeXML/> is responsible for
  switching advanced whitespace processing on and off.
* New attributes of <cmd/>: @nl1 and @nl2, new attributes of
  <env/>: @nl1, @nl2, @nl3 and @nl4. They are responsible for
  creation of new lines.
* New <spec/> symbols: new line and whitespace.
* A new command-line paramater '-w' (or '--width') specifies
  minimal width of lines that are subject to an automatical line
  breaking.


Version 1.01.devel (06 May 2004)

* The program now prints its version.
* The program now deletes leading spaces in <env/>.
* Element <env/> now supports children <opt/> and <parm/>.
  Elements <parm/> and <opt/> now support child <group/>.
  Thanks to Stephen Robertson for request for improvements.


Version 1.00 (09 April 2004)

* More ligatures are being processed: ``, '', ?`, !`. With -- and ---
  they cover all default non-letter TeX ligatures.
* Simon Goodson is proofreading the documentation.


Version 0.98.beta (02 April 2004)

* Text of specification is now better. Thanks Simon Goodson for
  ideas on improvement.
* New handling of tags <parm/> and <opt/>. The processor now outputs
  them instantly as they appear, and so multiple parameters of one
  <cmd/> are not being united.
* Absence of spaces after LaTeX commands in some mappings is fixed.


Version 0.95.beta (26 March 2004)

* Ligatures "--" and "---" are being processed. This is configurable.
* Escaping of TeX specials is configurable.
* Translation of empty line is configurable.
* Default encoding of output now is ascii, not utf8.
* ChangeLog file is created.


Version 0.91.beta (22 March 2004)

* Under Windows, TeXML processor now creates lines with DOS endings.
  Code should also work correctly in other systems (MacOS etc).


Version 0.90.beta (19 March 2004)

* First packaged version of the TeXML.
