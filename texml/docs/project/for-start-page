TeXML: an XML syntax for TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt)

* Do you generate TeX code? Then <a href="">download</a> and try TeXML.
* Do you convert XML to TeX? Then you must use TeXML.

Images. Two axes: x: convert, serialize; y: efforts.

First image
XML to TeX using Perl, Java
Big peak on "convert", small peak on "serialize"
100*k man-hours

Second image
XML to TeX using XSLT
Very small peak on "convert", big peak on "serialize"
100*k man-hours

Third image
XML to TeX using XSLT and TeXML
Very small peak on "convert", zero on "serialize".
k man-hours

Traditional languages are not convinient to work with XML. On the other side, when using XSLT, generating valid TeX syntax is nightmare. The solution is TeXML.

* TeXML is an XML syntax for TeX. XSLT is an ideal tool to convert XML to XML.
* A TeXML processor makes the rest, serializing TeXML to TeX.

More TeXML benefits:

* LaTeX and ConTeXt support.
* No need to bother about escaping TeX special characters.
* No need to bother about empty lines in paragraphs.
* More than 700 unicode characters are mapped to LaTeX commands.
* Support for international publishing.
* Generated TeX code is human-friendly.
* TODO: Open source under Apache license. Can be used in commercial applications.
