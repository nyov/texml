On TeXML whitespaces

Two modes of processing whitespaces:

1) print ws as is
2) collapse ws

// note on characters: all is forbidden, all except ws

+++ ws collapsing

Delete all ws before or after any tag.
Do not modify ws inside text.

Due to this approach, lines in result document may become very long.
It is not very good. 

// note: two characters calls

+++ making new lines

<cmd name="xxx" nl="1"/>

Attribute "nl" of "cmd" causes printing of newline after command.
Default is nl="0".


<env name="yyy" nl1="1" nl2="1" nl3="1" nl4="1"/>

Attribites "nlX" causes printing of newline:
nl1: before "\begin{yyy}"
nl2: after  "\begin{yyy}"
nl3: before "\end{yyy}"
nl4: after  "\end{yyy}"
Default is nl1=nl2=nl3=nl4=1

// nl1="1" or nl3="1" are ignored if already in the beginning of line



<spec cat="null"/>
<spec cat="nl"/>
