                        TeXML: an XML vocabulary for TeX

   Thesis of the talk at the First International conference of the
   open-source developers, Obninsk, Russia, 2004. Author: Oleg Paraschenko,
   Saint Petersburg.

     Abstract. The paper describes one of the methods of publishing XML
     documents through LaTeX. We propose to use TeXML, an intermediate
     presentation of the TeX notation in an XML format.

The need for TeXML

   TeXML[1] is an intermediate presentation of the TeX notation in a XML
   format. TeXML simplifies creation of printable versions of documents when
   following conditions are true:

     * original documents are in XML format,
     * printable versions are being created by LaTeX, and
     * XSLT is the best language for XML transformations.

   There are several projects that transform XML to LaTeX using XSLT. All
   these project stuck into the problem that XSLT is very inefficient when
   result of an XSLT transformation is not XML.

   This problem can be solved using an intermediate step. At first, XSLT
   efficiently transforms XML into the TeXML, and then TeXML processor
   serializes TeXML into the TeX format.

Brief overview of TeXML

   Basic constructions of TeXML are demonstrated in the example:

 <TeXML>
  <cmd name="documentclass">
   <opt>a4paper</opt>
   <parm>minimal</parm>
  </cmd>
  <env name="document">
   Eto&nbsp;&mdash; primer.
  </env>
 </TeXML>

   Result of serialization:

 \begin{verbatim}
 \documentclass[a4paper]{minimal}
 \begin{document}
 Eto~\textemdash{} primer.
 \end{document}

   Main tasks of the serializer:

     * escaping of the TeX special characters (for example, escaping "<" to
       "\textless"),
     * unicode processing (for example, printing russian letter "d" as is or
       as "\cyrchar\cyrd{}"),
     * disjoining of ligatures (for example, replacing "---" by "-{}-{}-"),
       and
     * avoiding empty lines in TeX output.

   In addition to these essential transformations, TeXML provides also
   extended functionality.

     * The TeXML language reflects the structured constructions of the LaTeX
       such as environments or commands with parameters.
     * Automatic layouting of TeX code produces nice human-readable
       documents.

TeXML benefits

   Simple TeXML code

 <group><cmd name="it" gr="0"/>\example</group>

   corresponds to the TeX fragment

 {\it \textbackslash{}example}

   There are several projects that create LaTeX from XML using XSLT, for
   example: tbook[2], xsltml[3] , dblatex[4] , db2latex[5] . History of these
   projects demonstrates following problems when generating the TeX fragment:

     * unescaped special symbols,
     * no space after command name (getting "\ittext" instead of "\it text"),
     * missed opening or closing brace,
     * only latin-1 encoding is supported.

   These and some other problems do not appear when using TeXML.

Other versions of TeXML

   During search for a solution for XML publishing through LaTeX I found that
   Douglas Lovell introduced[6] TeXML approach in the year 1999, and there
   was even an implementation in Java. This project, TeXMLatte[7], was
   abandoned a lot of years ago, but its specification survived. Our TeXML is
   heavely based on this specification.

   There is also TeXMLapis[8], a Perl-processor of a subset of TeXML, but its
   functionality is limited.
