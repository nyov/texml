                        TeXML: an XML vocabulary for TeX

   Thesis of the talk at the First International Conference of Open-Source
   Developers, Obninsk, Russia, 2004. Author: Oleg Paraschenko, Saint
   Petersburg.

     Abstract. The paper describes one of the methods of publishing XML
     documents through LaTeX. We propose to use TeXML, an intermediate
     presentation of TeX notation in an XML format.

The need for TeXML

   TeXML[1] is an intermediate presentation of TeX notation in an XML format.
   TeXML simplifies creation of printable versions of documents when the
   following conditions are true:

     * original documents are in XML format,
     * printable versions are being created by LaTeX, and
     * XSLT is the best language for XML transformations.

   There are several projects([2], [3], [4], [5]) that transform XML to LaTeX
   using XSLT. All of these projects have the same problem: XSLT is very
   inefficient when the result of an XSLT transformation is not XML.

   This problem can be solved using an intermediate step. First, XSLT
   efficiently transforms XML into TeXML, and then a TeXML processor turns
   TeXML into the TeX format.

Brief overview of TeXML

   An example to demonstrate the basic syntax of TeXML:

 <TeXML>
  <cmd name="documentclass">
   <opt>a4paper</opt>
   <parm>minimal</parm>
  </cmd>
  <env name="document">
   Eto&nbsp;&mdash; primer.
  </env>
 </TeXML>

   The results after processing:

 \begin{verbatim}
 \documentclass[a4paper]{minimal}
 \begin{document}
 Eto~\textemdash{} primer.
 \end{document}

   The main tasks of the processor:

     * escaping of the TeX special characters (for example, escaping "<" to
       "\textless"),
     * unicode processing (for example, printing russian letter "d" as is or
       as "\cyrchar\cyrd{}"),
     * disjoining of ligatures (for example, replacing "---" by "-{}-{}-"),
       and
     * avoiding empty lines in TeX output.

   In addition to these essential transformations, TeXML also provides
   extended functionality.

     * The TeXML language reflects the structured constructions of LaTeX such
       as environments or commands with parameters.
     * Automatic layout of TeX code into nice human-readable documents.

TeXML benefits

   A simple TeXML code

 <group><cmd name="it" gr="0"/>\example</group>

   corresponds to a TeX fragment

 {\it \textbackslash{}example}

   There are several projects that create LaTeX from XML using XSLT, for
   example: tbook[2], xsltml[3], dblatex[4], db2latex[5]. Usage of these
   projects demonstrates the following problems when generating the TeX
   fragment:

     * special symbols are not escaped,
     * space after a command name is missed (getting "\ittext" instead of
       "\it text"),
     * opening or closing brace is lost,
     * only latin-1 encoding is supported.

   These and some other problems do not appear when using TeXML.

Other versions of TeXML

   During my search for a solution for XML publishing through LaTeX, I found
   that Douglas Lovell introduced[6] the TeXML approach in the year 1999, and
   there was even an implementation in Java. This project, TeXMLatte[7], was
   abandoned some time ago, but its specification survived. Our TeXML is
   heavely based on this specification.

   There is also TeXMLapis[8], a Perl-processor of a subset of TeXML, but its
   functionality is limited.
