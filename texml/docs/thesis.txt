                        TeXML: an XML vocabulary for TeX

   Thesis of the talk at the First International conference of the
   open-source developers, Obninsk, Russia, 2004. Author: Oleg Paraschenko,

     Abstract. The work describes one of the methods of publishing XML
     documents through LaTeX. We propose to use TeXML, an intermediate
     presentation of the TeX notation in a XML format.

The need for TeXML

   TeXML is an intermediate presentation of the TeX notation in a XML format.
   TeXML simplifies creation of printable versions of documents when
   following conditions are true:

     * original documents are in XML format,
     * printable versions are being created by LaTeX, and
     * XSLT is the best language for XML transformations.

   There are several projects that transform XML to LaTeX using XSLT. All
   these project stuck into the problem that XSLT is very inefficient when
   result of an XSLT transformation is not XML.

   This problem can be solved using an intermediate step. At first, XSLT
   efficiently transforms XML into the TeXML, and then TeXML processor
   serializes TeXML into the TeX format.
